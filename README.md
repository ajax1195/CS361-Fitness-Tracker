# CS361-Fitness-Tracker
Fitness Tracker
Implements 3 user stories for Milestone #1:
  1) Add a workout (type, duration, calories) with validation and persistence
  2) View workout history (newest first)
  3) Filter workouts by type (Running, Cycling, Strength, Yoga, Other)

Data is saved to workouts.json in the same folder (simple JSON list).

Inclusivity + Usability touches (kept simple for CLI):
- Clear, plain-language prompts and errors (IH #1, IH #3)
- Explicit path via numbered menu (IH #6)
- No color-only cues; all messages are textual
